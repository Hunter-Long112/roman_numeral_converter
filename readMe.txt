# roman_numeral_converter

This is a very simple python project that converts numbers to roman numerals and vice versa. roman.py 
converts decimal numbers to roman numerals, namor.py converts roman numerals to decimal numbers, and 
romanamor.py checks that these two functions work by using roman.py to convert a number to a roman 
numeral and namor.py to convert that roman numeral back into a decimal number. All three are written 
in python3.
